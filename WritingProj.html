            <div class="story" ><p>My face was parallel to the sky as I craned to study the bust that sat sentinel at the center of that arch. It was a lion—solid, majestic, and alone amongst the sparse wisps of clouds. As I stood under its jaw for a moment, I realized acutely just how tiny I was, a dwarf compared to this inanimate stone. It already had outlived me and would do so time and time again. But there’s no point in envying a dead rock, I thought, as I tilted my phone on and snapped a photo.
<br>
In the future, I will flip through my photo gallery, which as of late has become a filing cabinet for my memories. I’ll think about this landmark’s grandness and how cheated it is by the smallness of my phone display, its towering meters condensed into pixels. The photos I took would let me resaturate my memory, which would have since dulled in the wake of time and soaked in the shadows of forgetfulness. They would repaint everything for me, like how the ducks had glided to and fro on the glittering water surface, rippling at the teasing touch of the wind. Or how the lagoon had looked like a jewel, scattering light this way and that as it painted an impressionist portrait of the palace in its reflection. I would remember everything, except for the perspective that I had felt then and there. I would loom over that tiny display, but it would never be the same as being loomed over by those rustic cypresses of stone. That would be something I could never recreate on a screen.
<br>
The serenity was breathtaking, so I willed my hand to stay put a moment before I left it snap another photo, before I jailed that beauty from five senses into one, three dimensions into two.</p></div>
