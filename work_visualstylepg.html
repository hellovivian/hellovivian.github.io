       <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p>Beginning of 2017, I worked with PhD student Sarah Sterman and undergraduate Evey Huang in an endeavor to create a human-computer interaction system dedicated to literature. Specifically, we wanted to computationally model prose style and teach a machine stylometry. What is stylometry? An apt, instructive example of the style spectrum would be to compare Hemingway's terse minimalism with Dickens' or Hugo's 19th century verboseness.</p>

               <h3>Spring 2017 Process</h3>
           <p> Sarah began working on this project in a graduate course we both took taught by professor Abigail de Kosnik, Making Sense of Cultural Data. Through the course, we were introduced to a spate of digital humanities tools (network analysis, web scraping, the works) that allowed us to model the mind of society/culture.</p> <br>
            <p>After the course, I hopped aboard Sarah's project as she brought it outside of the classroom and into realm of HCI research. We first began with literature review of natural language processing and the closest cousin to our stylometry question--authorship analysis. Then we conducted user studies, trying to gauge if style was something that could be universally characterized.</p><br>
         <p>Throughout Spring 2017, I began building a natural language feature analyzer using SpaCy, an NLP library. I vacillated finding new features and implementing them. I wrote and tested functions for everything from conventional part of speech tagging to unigram and bigram processing to hapax legomena (vocabulary richness). I spent three-day weekends thinking of how to architect the machine to not just read but gain an intuition based upon literary theory. To give you an idea of how diverse writing can be, take a look at this figure from the paper we submitted.</p><br>
         <p>Because we were encroaching on the domain of machine learning, I also explored support vector machines, using them to tackle the example I posed above by comparing a toy data set of excerpts derived from <em> Les Miserables</em> and <em>The Sun Also Rises</em></p><br>

      <h3>Fall 2017 Process</h3>
         <p> After a break during the summer working in <a onclick="image_onclick('peru')">Peru</a> and <a onclick="image_onclick('usc_ict')">USC Institute of Creative Tech</a>, I came back to the project during the fall. During this time, I worked on engineering the interface as we geared towards the DIS 2018 submission deadline using Javascript, d3.js, and Ruby on Rails.</p><br>
         <p>  At this time, I started working on the 'visual' part of our Visual Style project. We wanted to see if we could create a standard way to visualize our texts to represent how similar their stylistic footprints were. There was a lot of early exploration.</p><br>
         
         <p>By the end of fall, our pipeline looked like this, and we began conducting user studies by interviewing writers and other people interested in creativity support tools. We wrapped up our the first phase of our study as 2017 winded down.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p>Working with the researchers at Hybrid Ecologies was incredible--I used to describe it as people in a lab of people dedicated to mad science. Every project was eccentric, and Visual Style certainly was as well.</p><br>
         <p>Sarah was a great mentor, who was always receptive to my input. I was allowed to be apart of the experimental design process, which forced me to critically think not just about the data but how I would collect it. Every week, I realized that I was working with Sarah on a problem few had ever tackled before. You could say that Hybrid Ecologies truly taught me to understand the spirit of research.</p><br>
         <p> Working on this project also taught me that I have the capacity to learn everything. I would have never expected to touch support vector machines or unsupervised self organizing maps or any of the other concepts and techniques I wrangled with that spring otherwise.</p><br>
         <p>Working on the project also obviously gave me a grander purview of literature, both in the academic and traditional sense. I relaxed between discrete problem sets searching, cleaning, and reading great literature. I went to sleep with research about advances in machines learning style.</p><br>
         <p>For how it grew me as a writer, researcher, and a scientist, I will always be grateful.</p>
