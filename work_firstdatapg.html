          <h3>Purpose</h3>
         <p> My first internship during college was at the Big Data branch of a company known as First Data. There, I used Python and SQL to automate data pulling and data visualization. It was an experience that really expanded my mental horizons, because I had never seen a volume of data that big before. I learned how to look at numbers like a detective, and for awhile I even would attempt it on the weekends out of sheer curiosity.</p>

         <div id="row2" class="row">
            <div id="2left" class="left tile text ">
                      <h3>Process</h3>
         <p>My initial task was to aggregate data from a public source. To some degree, the team assumed that this would last me all summer. However, I learned how to interface with the API to automate that task, freeing myself to find harder and more fascinating work, of which there was plenty in Big Data. I proceeded to figure out what questions I could ask of the data I had collected and the data that I had access to. First Data's products are relevant to business growth and intelligence, so I learned what conclusions I could and could not draw from the two streams of public and corporate data I was analyzing. </p><br> 
         <p> After gleaning what I could from the sandbox of data before me, I also decided to flex my creative side to create an interface so that other people could input their queries and questions and be returned insights as well. Using Tableau, I created chloropleth maps, painting portraits with numbers as I aggregated data into maps as fine-grained as the zip code level. The prototype was documented, presented, and well-received by the team. </p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p>During this experience, I got to work across the company vertical with product designers, data scientists, and product managers. Since I carved out a niche with one subset of public numbers, I also had the ability at times to sit in with some executives and guide them in understanding what affordances those numbers could give them.</p><br>
         <p>This was my first time being mentored in a company dynamic, and I was very fortunate to have been given the freedom and chance to hone such a variety of industry skills in such a short period of time.</p>
