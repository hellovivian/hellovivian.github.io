     Throughout 2016 and 2017, I would teach STEAM (STEM + art and design) workshops for free at public places like the Fremont Main Library and the East Bay School for Boys. They emphasized creative coding. I did it because I really wanted students to see early on that math can be artsy, coding can be entertaining, and art has its geometry. I had the privilege of teaching kids as young as 5 to high school students everything from how to code recursive fractals to and how to program minimalist Mario games.

     Prior to my trip to Peru, I developed a curriculum that is a beginner's guide to makerspaces (en Espanol). These Powerpoints were my lesson plans, but they were not how we learned. Everyone learned through debugging and discussion, through Google Translate and helpful teachers.
      <br><br>
      To help them crystallize their knowledge into projects, we had the students help with the mouth mouse and a water conductivity sensor.
