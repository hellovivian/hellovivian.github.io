      In Peru, as part of the second cohort sent by the United Technologies for Kids (a Peruvian NGO), I went to Chincha, Peru to start a makerspace with a partner. There, at the Colegio of Santa Maria I taught a variety of design engineering concepts. Kids from 7th grade to 12th grade were introduced to Arduinos, 3D printing, soldering, and more.
         <br><br>
         On June 7th, they presented what they had learned in an educational fair in Lima. Also in Peru, we took drone videos, said our piece at press conference, and worked on projects with a <a href="ArduinoProj.html">social impact focus</a>. But most importantly, we got to know Peruvian kindness. There isn't a day that goes back where I don't think to this month in South America.

      For the latter half of the summer of 2017, I conducted research at USC's Institute of Creative Technologies, primarily doing programming tasks on an open-source Army Research Lab system called GIFT. 
         <br><br>
         Thanks to this program, I became very adept with understanding back-end controlled front-end, messaging concepts, and developing atop a very complicated system. As I did so, I got to experience one of the cultural capitals of the world, Los Angeles!

         My first internship during college was at the Big Data branch of a company known as First Data. There, I used Python and SQL to automate data pulling and data visualization. The experience really expanded my mental horizons, because I had never seen such a volume of data before. Learning how to be the detective behind the numbers was something that I would even attempt on my weekends. Through this experience I worked across the company vertical, with product designers, managers, and vice presidents. I also got to hone a bunch of skills, from UI/UX to SQL to Tableau.

         Since the beginning of 2017, I've been working with Sarah Sterman and Evey Huang on an interactive system to search literature through its stylistic fingerprint. We're making this system to see if we can

         Working on this project has taught me more than I could have imagined. From machine learning to natural language processing to stylometry theory, I've studied them all. My role dealt with architecting how the machine would read each piece of literature; I programmed the feature analyzing scripts and their data structures. 
         <br><br>
         I also designed the visualizations behind the search engine, which took a lot of experimenting on Javascript's d3 library. It was challenging balancing the need for something both universal and discriminable that was also aesthetic.

         Since this project is still ongoing, we'll see what I learn next.
