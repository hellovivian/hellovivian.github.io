         <h1>Visiting Research Assistant at USC Institute of Creative Technologies</h1>
         <img src="img/uscpic.png">
         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p>For the latter half of the summer of 2017 (after I worked in <a onclick="image_onclick('peru')" style="color: blue">Peru</a>), I conducted research for USC, primarily doing programming tasks on an open-source Army Research Lab project called GIFT. The idea behind GIFT was to create an intelligent tutoring system to streamline army training. My contributions included developing atop the system's back-end controlled user interface and creating an interface to let users graph their gateways.</p>
         <br><br>
         <h2>Process</h2>
         <p>The beginning of my summer was spent learning how to inherit a huge code base and contribute on top of it. After I familiarized myself with the system, I began to learn how to add functionalities, make cosmetic changes, and propagate info back to the system to be logged.<br><br> <img src="img/gift1.png"><img src="img/gift2.png"></p><br><br>
         <p>I also came around to bettering my Javascript through this internship, because I developed a web tool to draw and visualize gateways as graphs. To build it, I worked with JSON, Sigma (a graphing library), and data structures such as heaps. </p><img src="img/GIFTgraphs.png">
        <br>
         <p>After adding nodes as they pleased, the users would generate a string of JSON that would be parsed by some functions I wrote. With the help of Sigma, a graph would pop up in the center layout.</p>
         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p>Thanks to this program, I became very adept with living in unfamiliar code. I also became more adept at back-end, learning how it can control front-end as I worked up and down the stack. Conceptually, I learned a bit about messaging concepts as well. </p><br><br>
         <p>Best of all, I got to understand an institute that was as devoted to the arts as they were to the sciences. I would watch movies with my cohort that were rendered from technologies created at the Institute (i.e. Logan, Leon: the Professional--I don't know why they chose such graphic movies) and hear from luminaries in CG like Paul Debevec. I was amazed by my fellow researchers, who would work on evolutionary neural nets or study negotiation using virtual humans. </p><br><br>

         <p>(As an aside, I was also ecstatic to explore one of the cultural capitals of the world, Los Angeles!)</p>

         <h1>Tech Intern at First Data</h1>
         <img src="img/first_data.png">
         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p> My first internship during college was at the Big Data branch of a company known as First Data. There, I used Python and SQL to automate data pulling and data visualization. It was an experience that really expanded my mental horizons, because I had never seen a volume of data that big before. I learned how to look at numbers like a detective, and for awhile I even would attempt it on the weekends out of sheer curiosity.</p>
         <button class="collapsible"></button>
            <div class="content">
          <p>My initial task was to aggregate data from a public source. To some degree, the team assumed that this would last me all summer. However, I learned how to interface with the API to automate that task, freeing myself to find harder and more fascinating work, of which there was plenty in Big Data. I proceeded to figure out what questions I could ask of the data I had collected and the data that I had access to. First Data's products are relevant to business growth and intelligence, so I learned what conclusions I could and could not draw from the two streams of public and corporate data I was analyzing. </p>

         <p> After gleaning what I could from the sandbox of data before me, I also decided to flex my creative side to create an interface so that other people could input their queries and questions and be returned insights as well. Using Tableau, I created chloropleth maps, painting portraits with numbers as I aggregated data into maps as fine-grained as the zip code level. The prototype was documented, presented, and well-received by the team. </p>
         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p>During this experience, I got to work across the company vertical with product designers, data scientists, and product managers. Since I carved out a niche with one subset of public numbers, I also had the ability at times to sit in with some executives and guide them in understanding what affordances those numbers could give them.</p><br>
         <p>This was my first time being mentored in a company dynamic, and I was very fortunate to have been given the freedom and chance to hone such a variety of industry skills in such a short period of time.</p>

      <h1>The Mouth/Chin-Operated Mouse</h1>
      <img src="img/mouthmouse1.png"></a>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p> When I worked in abroad during Peru, my teaching partner and I were introduced to a quadriplegic girl and asked if we could create something akin to LipSync, which is a sip-and-puff assistive tech mouse for people who can't use their limbs.</p><br><p> Though we were strapped for resources and for time, we worked on the prototype day in and day out when we weren't preparing for our workshops. What we produced within a week was a Arduino-powered mouse capable of moving and clicking as per mouth movement. </p> <br> 
      <h2>Process</h2><p> Though we had scaffolding from a previous opensource iteration (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PC-Mouse-Made-With-Arduino-Uno-and-Joystick/">credit</a>), adapting the design for our user was incredibly challenging. All we had were the electronics, drone equipment, and two 3D printers that we had brought over. We began by hacking apart a drone remote controller, because we needed its joystick. After that, my partner and I partitioned the tasks so that I would handle the software and circuits and he would handle the physical making. He came up with a clever way to instigate pressure on the force sensitive resistor: through a mini pressure chamber created by the close of the mouth over an 3D printed orifice.<br></p><p>In parallel, I worked on the Java that would allow the Arduino input to take over the computer's mouse. This was taxing, because I had not seen Java or Intellij in a while, was unfamiliar coding on a PC, and was without consistent access to Internet/Stack Overflow to remedy this.</p><br>
      <p>As I acclimated to my new developer environment, I wrangled with the bugs in the opensource code and experimented with types of interaction. After finally debugging all the bugs in the open source code by rewriting large chunks of it for the particular PC I worked on, I explored speech commands while my partner worked on pressure-chamber-enabled clicks. My method was to parse the cluck of a tongue into a left click, making for a more hygenic and easy interaction. However, this hope was dashed when we realized that there would be simply too much irrelevant positive feedback.
      </p><br><p>The pressure chamber had a slit through which the head of a force sensitive resistor could fit through. When the air filled the chamber in, it read a value that we normalized for. The lips would cover the cone of the chamber so that any tilt would lead translate to action on the computer screen. And when the air was sucked out, we produced a click.</p><br>
      <p>The housing and chamber were completely 3D printed, and we enlisted our students to help us during the CAD design process so that they could apply their new skills.</p><br> Though we made it as far as a high-fidelity prototype, the mouse in the end did not perform consistently enough for everyday use.
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Out of every project that I had ever done, this project was the most humbling. I am cautious by nature, and I was not sure that I could handle teaching on top of this project, which was aligned with UTK's social impact mission. There was more riding on this project than just a grade, like how it is in college. Even more than that, there was a person who needed it and who wanted it. I applied myself with 200 percent, and learned a lot of lessons along the way.</p><br>
      <p> The greatest lesson that it taught me was that users must be included in the design process. When I watched the girl we had made this prototype for struggle with our device, all the pride I had built up from the engineering feat I had pulled all-nighter after all-nighter for waned fast. UX was right--question first before you create the solutions.</p><br>
      <p> When I came back to the States, I was so disappointed that I couldn't finish the project that I restarted it when fall semester at Berkeley rolled around by myself. I worked on a chin-operated mouse this time, which made for a more sanitary option than a mouth one. Other improvements included a dexterous joystick and a mounted button at the top of the rod, which made for easy clicking at the simple push of the head.</p><br>

      <img src="img/mouthmouse2.png">
           <br>
   <p> By the time I had completed this iteration though, the girl had already gotten a LipSync alternative from Hong Kong. She's really happy with it, and that's all that I can ask for.</p>

         <h1>STEAM Workshops at East Bay School for Boys<br> and Fremont Main Library</h1>
         <h2>Purpose</h2>
         <p> Something I wanted to encourage within the community I grew up within was the notion that art and science don't have to exist in a dichotomy. There are so many ways to strike synergy between the two domains, and I wanted to give back during my sophomore year. </p><br><br> 
         <p>This was how I began a series of workshops which taught kids anywhere from five to seventeen the beauty of: generating fractals as art, coding optical illusions, building a minimalist Mario game, web animation</p>

         <img src="img/steam6.png"><br><br>
         <h2>Process</h2>
         <p> In high school, I had volunteered for a program called Science for Youth at my local library. In college, I reached out to the same coordinators and asked if I could volunteer again and hold free workshops revolving around creative computing.</p><br><br>
         <p>What began at Fremont Main Library eventually carried over to a few workshops at East Bay School for Boys, a school neighboring Berkeley that I had conducted field work at during Spring 2017.</p> <br><br>
         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p> Each workshop lasted a hectic 1.5 hours, during which I juggled teaching and helping kids debug. However, there really is nothing more amazing than hearing a student exclaim to their parent, "That was amazing!" My efforts in teaching creative computing helped students discover a little more about their world and realize that they each have the innate ability to craft it as well.</p> <br><br>
