          <h3>Purpose</h3>
         <p> This summer, I learned about the Open Prosthetics initiative as I became a volunteer workshop presenter for Girls in Engineering. </p>

                  <h3>Process</h3>
               <p>Throughout June, I learned how to use the Ultimaker series to print the parts to a Raptor hand. Using engineering diagrams, I then pieced together the articulated hand. In July, I presented on Open Prosthetics to dozens of girls from the ages of 10 to 17, and helped them assemble hands as well. I was also there to present and share some of my own work, which tends to involve both art and engineering. </p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
               <p>Hands are really beautiful things. The dexterity that comes from their 27 degrees of freedom is stunning. As I learned in a course on bio-inspired design once, nature is an incredible tinkerer. But engineering is wonderful too, and the fact that we can replicate the functionality of hands through digital fabrication is a testament to that.</p><br><br>
               <p>I was really honored that Girls in Engineering let me speak and share about myself.</p>
