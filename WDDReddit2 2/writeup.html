<p>Home View:
To remove clutter and make our design more minimalistic and modern, we kept only one of the two navigation bars. Some synonymous tabs were removed (i.e. “HOT”, “RISING”). To centralize user experience, we consolidated buttons and drop-downs related to the user in a fixed sidebar. This would be their personal portal where they could follow their subreddits or create a new post. This way they could easily access their contributions to Reddit.

<p>Post View:
For a consistent user interface, we included the sidebar/personal portal again. We created a new sidebar on the right to contain information relevant to the post, such as its statistics and related subreddits. There is a large input box in the center, inviting the user to continue the conversation thread.

<p>Search View:
For the search page, we decided to have two parallel containers display our results. One would show relevant subreddits, and the other would show relevant posts. This way, users would not have to scroll past a container of result subreddits to look at result posts. The formatting of the posts shown would be consistent with the formatting of the posts in the home view. (This is unfortunately not the case with the current Reddit.)

<p>Design:
We went with blue for our theme color, because it is a neutral, general-purpose color. We used sans-serif Lato, gradient backgrounds, and rounded rectangles, because they all contribute to a more modern look and feel. We used transparent backgrounds to accent, add contrast, and give structure to our pages. By containing the content in sidebars, containers, and navigation bars, we introduced the empty space that the current Reddit desperately needs.
