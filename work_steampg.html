         <h3>Purpose</h3>
         <p> Something I wanted to encourage within the community I grew up within was the notion that art and science don't have to exist in a dichotomy. There are so many ways to strike synergy between the two domains, and I wanted to give back during my sophomore year. </p><br><br> 
         <p>This was how I began a series of workshops which taught kids anywhere from five to seventeen the beauty of: generating fractals as art, coding optical illusions, building a minimalist Mario game, web animation</p>

                  <h3>Process</h3>
       <p> In high school, I had volunteered for a program called Science for Youth at my local library. In college, I reached out to the same coordinators and asked if I could volunteer again and hold free workshops revolving around creative computing.</p><br><br>
         <p>What began at Fremont Main Library eventually carried over to a few workshops at East Bay School for Boys, a school neighboring Berkeley that I had conducted field work at during Spring 2017.</p> <br><br>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
       <p> Each workshop lasted a hectic 1.5 hours, during which I juggled teaching and helping kids debug. However, there really is nothing more amazing than hearing a student exclaim to their parent, "That was amazing!" My efforts in teaching creative computing helped students discover a little more about their world and realize that they each have the innate ability to craft it as well.</p> <br><br>
