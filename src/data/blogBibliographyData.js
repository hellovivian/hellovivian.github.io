It dives into what style means, what value it has in economic contexts of creative work, and why style transfer approaches lack the nuance that artists have in expressing semantics and style together.' },

Web standards that emerged are a confounding factor -- but still.' },

They pictorally describe this in a simple Venn Diagram form between H (Humans) and M (Machines). In the case of chess, that is AlphaZero (M) discovering concepts within chess puzzles that grandmasters (H) could then intuit.' },
